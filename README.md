Epicodus: Week6, Day5

**********************

Lesson

This is a command-line app to track a family tree. It's an exercise in using Active Record without Rails, and playing around with associations that aren't always straightforward.

Here are the features I want you to build:

*  Let users enter a person, and describe that person as the child of two people.

*  Flesh out the user interface to show a list of people, and lets you choose one to see who they're married to and who their parents are.

*  Show who somebody's grandparents and grandchildren are.

*  Add support for siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc.  (WORKING DISPLAYING ON ALL GRANDPARENTS)
